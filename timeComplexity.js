/** 
 * There is so many notation
 
 * 
 * O(1) - Constant time complexity.

Example: Accessing an element by index in an array.


O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity.

Example: Binary search in a sorted array.
O(n) - Linear time complexity.

Example: Finding an element in an unsorted array through linear search.
O(n log n) - Linearithmic time complexity.

Example: Most efficient comparison-based sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort.
O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity.

Example: Nested loops iterating over the same collection.
O(n^3) - Cubic time complexity.

Example: Three nested loops iterating over the same collection.
O(2^n) - Exponential time complexity.

Example: Recursive algorithms that solve problems through a tree structure, like the recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem.
O(n!) - Factorial time complexity.

Example: Algorithms generating all permutations of a set.
